# MusicTransformer ðŸŽµ

**Status: Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. We're building a music transformer model that can process and generate MIDI music data.

## What We're Working On

- **MIDI Tokenization**: Converting MIDI files to token sequences and back
- **Music Generation**: Training transformer models on musical data
- **Audio Processing**: Handling different musical instruments and compositions

## Current Features

- âœ… MIDI to token conversion
- âœ… Token to MIDI reconstruction
- âœ… Support for multiple instruments
- âœ… Velocity and timing preservation



## TODO

- [ ] Implement transformer model architecture
- [ ] Add training pipeline
- [ ] Create evaluation metrics
- [ ] Add more sophisticated preprocessing
- [ ] Support for different musical styles
- [ ] Model checkpointing and saving

## Contributing

This project is actively being developed. Feel free to explore the code and contribute ideas!
